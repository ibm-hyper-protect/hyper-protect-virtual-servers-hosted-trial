# Deploy your Securely Built Application as a Hyper Protect Virtual Server


1. Register the repository on the secure service partition for the application image by using the generated repository registration file. The repository registration file is generated by using the `hpvs sb regfile` command. See [Securely Build your Application](build.md){target=_blank} for details of how the repository registration file is generated.
   ```
   hpvs repository register --pgp=encryptedRepoRegistration_mongo.enc --id=MyDockerRepo
   ```

2. Create the quotagroup of the application image on the Secure Service partition.
   ```
   hpvs quotagroup create --name myquotagroup --size=30GB
   ```

3. Deploy the application image into the Secure Service partition as a Hyper Protect Virtual Server instance.
   ```
   hpvs vs create --name testcontainer --repo MyDockerRepo --tag latest --cpu 2 --ram 2048 --env={env_var1=value1,env_var2=value2} --quotagroup "{quotagroup = myquotagroup, mountid = new, mount = /newroot, filesystem = btrfs, size = 25GB}" --network "{name = external_net,ip = 10.20.4.73}"
   ```
