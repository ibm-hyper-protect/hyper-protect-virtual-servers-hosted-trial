## Cleanup Docker Token

Delete the existing Docker Token by logging into your `Docker Hub` account and following [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/#modify-existing-tokens){target=_blank}

## Cleanup GitHub ssh key

Delete the ssh key you added for the lab following steps 1-3 of [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/reviewing-your-ssh-keys){target=_blank}

## Cleanup Lab directory

You can remove the directory you stored your files in throughout the lab. This is a personal choice as the lab machine will be deleted after the lab anyway.

``` bash
rm -rf "${SB_DIR}"
```
