# Hyper Protect Virtual Servers (HPVS) Hosted Trial Process Overview

## Prerequisites

See the [`Prerequisites` page](../prerequisites.md){target=_blank} to complete the prerequisites for this lab. This includes creating accounts and credentials to access the Source Code Management (SCM) [GitHub](https://github.com){target=_blank} and the Docker Image Management (Docker Registry) [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/){target=_blank} for the lab.

## The Big Picture

There are 5 steps of the Secure Build process:

1. [SETUP](#setup)
2. [BUILD](#build)
3. [REGISTER](#register)
4. [DEPLOY](#deploy)
5. [ACCESS](#access)

(and how to [CLEAN UP](#cleanup)) are explained in more detail in their respective sections below.

### SETUP

Configure your environment with the necessary credentials to connect to [GitHub](https://github.com){target=_blank} and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/){target=_blank} respectively ([see `Configuring your Environment`](securebuild-setup.md){target=_blank}).

### BUILD

Securely build a Docker Image. see [`Create your HPVS Secure Build Server`](create-server.md){target=_blank}, or [`Create your HPVS Secure Build Server by using the YAML configuration file and `hpvs deploy` command`](create-server-hpvsdeploy.md){target=_blank}, and [`Securely Build your Application`](build.md){target=_blank}). This uses the Secure Build Process detailed below[^1]:

![Secure Build Overview](Overview_Images/Secure_Build_Overview.png)


The Secure Build Process leverages a **Hyper Protect Virtual Server**, called the Secure Build Server, to establish trust and security in the [Docker Content Trust](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/){target=_blank} process. This ensure images verified using the [Notary service architecture](https://docs.docker.com/notary/service_architecture/){target=_blank} were safely built and signed. This is done by generating the repository and root keys used to establish trust with the [Notary Service](https://docs.docker.com/notary/service_architecture/){target=_blank} inside of the Secure Build server to guarantee that the initial keys used for a repository are trusted on first use (solving the [TOFU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use){target=_blank} problem).

However, those aren't the  only keys used throughout the lab. The table below illustrates all of the different keys used throughout the secure build process, what they do, how they are created, and who is ultimately responsible for them.
