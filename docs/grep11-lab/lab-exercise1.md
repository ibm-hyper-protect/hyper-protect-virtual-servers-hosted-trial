# Exercise 1 - List Mechanisms

## Explanation of Mechanisms

*Mechanisms* is the PKCS #11 standard's fancy word for *algorithms*.  

In the introduction of the *PKCS#11 Cryptographic Token Interface Base Specification 2.40* document, there is this statement: *Details of cryptographic mechanisms (algorithms) may be found in the associated PKCS#11 Mechanisms documents.*

And then in the *PKCS#11 Cryptographic Token Interface Current Mechanisms Specification Version 2.40* it says `A mechanism specifies precisely how a certain cryptographic process is to be performed.`

This exercise will list the mechanisms supported by the Crypto Express card in EP11 mode.

The program that you will invoke in this exercise issues a *GetMechanismList()* function call to the GREP11 server, and then it will iterate through the list returned, calling *GetMechanismInfo()* against each mechanism to obtain more info about it. 

Run the program and then a brief discussion of the results will follow:

1. You may wish to view the source code used by the lab exercises while running them.  It is handy to expand the *Outline* view in the left pane of Visual Studio Code which will show the various function and type definitions of the source code you have highlighted in the main portion of the Visual Studio Code window.  The Outline view may not be necessary for smaller source code files but it comes in handy for some of the larger source code files. The screen snippet below shows where the Outline view is:

2. Change to the lab directory in your terminal:

    ``` bash
    cd ../lab
    ```

3. In the prior section, the *go test* command built the executable file it needed transparently to us. For our lab exercises, we need to build the executable binary.  We will use a single executable for all of the exercises, and invoke the various exercises through command line arguments. Build the executable now with this command:

    ``` bash
    go build
    ```
   
    !!! note
        The absence of any messages is your indication of success!

4. The `go build` command should have created an excutable file that shares the name of the directory in which you are working- `lab`. List that file and you should see it has a recent date and timestamp.

    ``` bash
    ls -l lab
    ```

    ???+ example "Example output"
    
        ``` bash
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 hyper-protect-lab hyper-protect-lab 17545825 Jul  8 06:26 lab
        ```

    !!! tip
        You may be doing this lab in a virtual machine whose clock is set for a time zone different from where you are. You can always issue the `date` command to see what time your virtual machine thinks it is at the moment.

5. Run the first exercise by passing the appropriate argument, shown below, to the *lab* program:

    ``` bash
    ./lab --ex1
    ```

    ??? example "Example output"

        ```

## Explanation of exercise output

Near the top of the output, you see the line:

`Got mechanism list of length 92:` 

This indicates there were 92 mechanisms returned by the call to *GetMechanismList()*.

Then, for each mechanism, two lines of output are created, one with the mechanism name, which usually start with `CKM_`.  The mechanism number has no significance, this is just an index number assigned by our lab program, starting at 0 and incremented by the program as it iterates over the list.

The information returned by *GetMechanismInfo()* includes the minimum key size and maximum key size for the mechanism, if applicable, and flags that are associated with the mechanism.  The numbers shown are in decimal, and the key sizes shown are in bytes.

!!! Tip
    If you are doing this lab at your leisure on your own system, you could look in *golang/ep11/header_consts.go* and find the flags within lines 596 through 649 of that file.  You'd have to convert the decimal value shown to hexadecimal.  If you are taking this lab as part of a virtual event, do not take the time now to deconstruct these flags-  you can always do that later since this lab is publicly available.

Observe that the large majority of mechanisms in the list have a name starting with *CKM_*, while a handful, such as item 77, 79, 81, and others, do not.  It appears that if the mechanism is not listed in the *golang/ep11/header_consts.go* file, within lines 205 to 594, then it will not have a name starting with *CKM_*.

Note that the PKCS #11 specification does not mandate that an implementation support all defined mechanisms. Even within the subset of the 92 mechanisms that are supported by IBM's EP11 library, some are for algorithms that are considered rather outdated, and, in some cases, downright insecure.  For example, the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm is considered insecure these days, so any mechanims in the list that have SHA1 or SHA_1 in their name (and there are some) should be avoided.

Let's move on to Exercise 2.
